# Project 1..................................................................................................................
Arithmetic Calculator Using Tkinter

Project Overview:
As part of my CodSoft internship project, I developed a basic arithmetic calculator using the Tkinter library in Python. This project demonstrates my skills in GUI programming and event handling in Python.

Features:
- User-friendly interface to input two numbers.
- Selection of arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.
- Real-time calculation and display of results.

Components:
Main Window: Configured with a specific title, size, and background color.
Labels and Entry Widgets: For guiding user input.
Radio Buttons: For selecting operations.
Calculate Button: Triggers the calculation process.
Result Label: Displays the result or any error messages.

Functionality:
- The calculate() function handles user inputs, performs the selected operation, and updates the result label with the outcome.

Technology Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.

Event Handling:
- Button click event to trigger the calculation function.

Libraries:
- Tkinter for GUI components and window management.

This project was a valuable experience in building a simple yet functional calculator application, enhancing my understanding of GUI development and user interaction handling in Python.

Password Generator Using Tkinter

Project Overview:
As part of my CodSoft internship project, I developed a basic password generator using the Tkinter library in Python. This project demonstrates my skills in GUI programming, random character generation, and input validation in Python.

Features:
- User-friendly interface to input the desired length of the password.
- Real-time generation of a random password containing letters, digits, and punctuation characters.
- Display of the generated password or any error messages.

Components:
-Main Window: Configured with a specific title, size, and background color.
-Labels and Entry Widgets: For guiding user input and displaying the generated password.
-Generate Button: Triggers the password generation process.
-Result Label: Displays the generated password or error messages.

Functionality:
-The generate_password() function handles user inputs, validates the input length, generates a random password, and updates the result label with the outcome.

Technology Used:
-Python: Core programming language.
-Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
-Random: For generating random characters.
-String: For accessing string constants like letters, digits, and punctuation.

Event Handling:
- Button click event to trigger the password generation function.

Libraries:
- Tkinter for GUI components and window management.
- Random for generating random characters.
- String for providing character sets used in password generation.

This project was a valuable experience in building a simple yet functional password generator application, enhancing my understanding of GUI development and user interaction handling in Python.

Project Title:
Contact Management System Using Tkinter

Project Overview:
As part of my CodSoft internship project, I developed a Contact Management System using the Tkinter library in Python. This project demonstrates my skills in GUI programming, user input handling, and data management in Python.

Features:
1. Add New Contact: Allows users to add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, and address.
2. View Contact Details: Displays detailed information about a selected contact.
3. Update Contact: Enables modification of existing contact details.
4. Delete Contact: Removes a selected contact from the contact list.
5. Search Contact: Searches for a contact by name or phone number and displays the details if found.

Components:
1. Main Window: The primary interface of the application.
2. Contact Listbox: A list box to display all contacts.
3. Buttons: 
   - Add Contact
   - View Contact
   - Update Contact
   - Delete Contact
   - Search Contact

Functions:
1. add_new_contact(): Prompts the user to input new contact details and adds the contact to the dictionary.
2. refresh_contact_display(): Updates the contact list display in the Listbox.
3. view_contact_details(): Shows the details of the selected contact.
4. modify_contact(): Allows the user to modify the details of a selected contact.
5. remove_contact(): Deletes the selected contact from the contact list.
6. find_contact(): Searches for a contact by name or phone number.

 Technology:
- Programming Language: Python
- GUI Library: Tkinter

Event Handling:
- Button clicks to add, view, update, delete, and search contacts are handled using Tkinter's command parameter.

 Libraries Used:
- tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- messagebox: For displaying message boxes.
- simpledialog: For taking user input through dialog boxes.
